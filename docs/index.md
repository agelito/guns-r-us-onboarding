# Welcome to Guns 'R' Us Toy Company

We're happy to welcome you to GUNS- since each member have a different background and experience in Eve Online we've prepared this document to help you get onboarded as smoothly as possible. This document will acts as a reference since we the TWATs (The Wompling Assistance Team Squad) team will also be here to help.

## Our Home
We live in Paragon Soul and Esoteria as part of Sigma Grindset alliance. Our staging system is [O4T-Z5](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Paragon_Soul/O4T-Z5). This is where we have our main staging Keepstar and market. This should be set as home station unless specified otherwise during war deployments.

## Alliance Auth & Services
Communication and organization is essential in Eve Online. We use alliance auth to grant access to [Discord](https://discord.com/) (for messaging) and [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/downloads/) (for voice chat). Additionally since we're part of Sigma Grindset (alliance) and Imperium (coalition) those also need to be registered.

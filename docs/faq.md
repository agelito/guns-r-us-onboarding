# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the activity requirements for being in Guns?
You have to have been in-game for at least 30 days, and can’t join with just an alt of another character.

We don’t have any specific activity requirements. Inactive accounts will be purged every couple of months, but there is no obligation to log in for any specific fleet.

We will ping out things with varying levels of importance, from fun fleets up to CTA (Call-To-Arms). If you’re online and available, then you are expected to attend the more serious CTA pings, but real life comes first, and if you can’t make it, we understand.

## Where are you located?
Guns is part of Sigma Grindset alliance. We control all of Paragon Soul, and the southern half of Esoteria. As part of the Imperium, you also have access to all of their space, covering approximately seven regions in south and western New Eden.

## How do I get my stuff out there?
We have an efficient jump freighter network that can move anything you want from Jita and Amarr to our staging system, however you’ll find we also have a well stocked trade hub and contract system locally for people to trade in.

## Where can I sell my stuff?
We have a busy market in our staging system where many things can be sold. We also have access to the Imperium, including their trade hub in 1DQ. As well, our jump freighters can take things you’d like to sell to the trade hubs if you’d rather sell them that way.

## Do I need to be on comms to join?
Short answer: **Yes**.

We use Mumble for our voice comms. In null sec, you are safest when you’re part of a group, and that group can communicate best by being able to provide quick, real-time feedback. That includes being able to talk to each other. You are not required to participate in the day-to-day chatter, although it does help you to get to know your corp-mates and the people you fly with, and can make it more comfortable when you’re on a fleet.

Being on comms allows you to ask for help, and relay information if you’re in trouble. We don’t want you to die quietly, we want to join the fight.

## I’m new to null, can you help?
We’ve got an entire group dedicated to helping people learn everything from being in null for the first time, to flying your first capitals. We also have people dedicated to industry, mining, fitting ship, market-trading, all of whom are happy to help you learn and grow
